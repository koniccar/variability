# Variability

This repository contains a MATLAB Live Script (`mean_variability_coupling.mlx`) and its PDF export
(`mean_variability_coupling.pdf`) documenting the same complete analysis workflow used in the paper:

**Is Temporal Variability a Standalone Predictor in Medical Data?  
An Actigraphy Study in Bipolar Disorder**

submitted to **MIE 2026 (EFMI Conference)**.

The material is provided to support methodological transparency and reproducibility.
Due to ethical and privacy constraints, raw clinical actigraphy data are not shared.

All preprocessing, transformation, aggregation, and statistical modeling steps are fully specified
in the Live Script and identically reflected in the PDF.
